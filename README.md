# Test Foundation Accordion

I'm not the biggest fun of large front-end frameworks for couple of reasons.

* There are lot's of extra code I don't need.
* I don't understand what's going on.
* I feel like I lose control.

But there are times when frameworks like [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) can be really helpful.

* They do have lot's of great front-end components and lot's of people have tested those.
* Why invent the wheel all over again.
* Foundation have improved a lot what comes to accessibility.

I wanted to test can I easily use and take only Foundation [Accordion component](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/accordion.html), and research what pros and cons it might have.

This plugin is a proof of concept of that research. I'll try to write a blog post about it sooner or later.
